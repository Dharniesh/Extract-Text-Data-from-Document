# Extracting data from Images using OCR-NER and Machine Learning Techniques
This is a project that demonstrates the use of OCR-NER and machine learning techniques to extract data from images. The project involves the use of several libraries, including numpy, pandas, cv2, ocr-ner, and spacy.

## Installation
To run this project, you must have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`pip install numpy pandas opencv-python ocr-ner spacy`


You must also download the necessary data files for the spacy library. To do this, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

## Usage

To use this project, you must first download or clone the repository to your computer. Once you have done this, navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`python preprocess.py`

This will run the program and extract the data from the sample image provided in the images directory. You can modify the program to extract data from other images by changing the image file path in the main function of the main.py file.
